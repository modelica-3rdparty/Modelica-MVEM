Modelica-MVEMLib is a free Modelica implementation of a Mean Value Engine modeling framework. The final goal is to implement a free and complete vehicle simulation library that can be run in both Dymola as well as other Modelica implementations, such as OpenModelica.

Installation and requirements

The code currently requires Dymola and has successfully been used with
Dymola 7.4. While it should be possible to use with other Modelica
implementations, such as openModelica. However, the Modelica Media
implementation is a moving target which complicates things
somewhat. Installation is simple, just clone the git repository and
load the library.
